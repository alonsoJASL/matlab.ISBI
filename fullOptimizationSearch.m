% script file: Full Optimization Search
% 
% This file does the same optimization procedure as the bash script
% file:
%                  SW/BASH/fullOptimizationSerch.sh
%
% But this has the intention to evolve into a more sofisticated
% optimization routine than a simple brute force approach. This might
% then be used to train the parameters given the type folder (i.e the
% type of channel) that is going to be tested.
